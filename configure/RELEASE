# RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES to this file you must subsequently
# do a "gnumake rebuild" in this application's top level
# directory.
#
# The build process does not check dependencies against files
# that are outside this application, thus you should do a
# "gnumake rebuild" in the top level directory after EPICS_BASE
# or any other external module pointed to below is rebuilt.
#
# Host- or target-specific settings can be given in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)
#
# This file should ONLY define paths to other support modules,
# or include statements that pull in similar RELEASE files.
# Build settings that are NOT module paths should appear in a
# CONFIG_SITE file.

# Defines the prebuilt bundle location.
# Filled in at bundle build time

BUNDLE=

# Modify this to reference to __your__ local QE Framework installation.
# 
QE_FRAMEWORK=$(BUNDLE)/gui/qeframework

# Modify this to reference to __your__ local caQtDM installation.
# Uncomment only if integration with PSI's caQtDM needed.
# Note: CAQTDM intermediate is defined for Australian Synchrotron build system only.
#
# CAQTDM=$(BUNDLE)/gui/caqtdm
# QE_CAQTDM=$(CAQTDM)/caqtdmApp/src

# EPICS_BASE usually appears last so other apps can override stuff:
# Modify this to reference to __your__ local EPICS base installation.
#
EPICS_BASE=$(BUNDLE)/epics/base

# These lines allow developers to override these RELEASE settings
# without having to modify this file directly.
